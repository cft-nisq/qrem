   Constants Module for QREM
   =========================

   Constants Module in the QREM (Quantum Readout Error Mitigation) package defines various
   constants and configurations used throughout the project. These constants are central to maintaining
   consistency and accuracy in quantum computations and data handling.

   .. attribute:: SIGNIFICANT_DIGITS

      The default number of significant digits to be used in numerical computations within QREM.
      Currently set to 9, this value determines the precision level for general numerical outputs.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: SIGNIFICANT_DIGITS_POVM

      Defines the number of significant digits specifically for computations involving Positive
      Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs). A precision of 7 significant digits is used for these
      specialized calculations.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: EXPERIMENT_TYPE_SYMBOLS

      A dictionary mapping different types of quantum experiments to specific numerical codes.
      Each experiment type, such as 'qdot', 'ddot', etc. , is associated with a unique integer.
      These codes are used for categorizing and identifying experiments within the QREM system.

      :type: dict

   .. attribute:: CIRCUIT_DATA_TYPE

      Specifies the data type for storing circuit data, using NumPy's `dtype` for efficient and
      consistent data handling. Set to `np.uint8`, it optimizes memory usage for circuit representation.

      :type: numpy.dtype

   .. attribute:: CIRC_EFFECT_DISTANCE

      A constant defining a threshold or reference distance value used in circuit total count estimations.
      This parameter plays a role in calculations related to the spatial aspects of circuit layouts or effects.

      :type: float

   .. attribute:: CIRC_PROBABILITY_OF_FAIL

      Represents the estimated probability of failure for a given circuit. Set to 0.5, this constant is
      used in various probabilistic analyses and estimations regarding circuit performance and reliability.

      :type: float

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - The choice of significant digits, both general and POVM-specific, reflects a balance between
     computational efficiency and the precision required for quantum computations.
   - The `EXPERIMENT_TYPE_SYMBOLS` dictionary can be expanded as new types of quantum experiments are
     incorporated into the QREM project.
   - The `CIRCUIT_DATA_TYPE` is aligned with the typical data requirements for quantum circuits, ensuring
     that the data structures used are both memory-efficient and sufficient for the intended computations.
   - The `CIRC_EFFECT_DISTANCE` and `CIRC_PROBABILITY_OF_FAIL` constants are crucial for simulations and
     estimations that factor in circuit layout and reliability within quantum experiments.

   QREM (Quantum Research Environment Manager) Common Utilities
   ============================================================

   This subpackage `qrem.common` provides a suite of utility modules specifically tailored for the QREM project.
   It encompasses a range of functionalities from configuration loading to mathematical computations and file operations
   in the context of Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM).

   Modules
   -------
   config
       Provides functionality for parsing configuration files and command-line arguments
       in the Quantum Research Environment Manager (QREM) project. It's designed to streamline
       the setup and customization of the QREM environment.

   constants
       This module maintains all the mathematical constants, threshold values, and other
       constant parameters required across the `qrem` package. It serves as a central repository
       for constants to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance.

   convert
       Contains helper functions for converting between various formats used to describe
       circuit labels, bitstrings, quantum registers, etc. This module aids in interoperability
       between different quantum computing representations.

   experiment
       subpackage contains functions and classes related to quantum tomography
       and creation of random set of cicrcuits.

   io
       Provides utility functions for handling dates and file operations in a QREM context.
       Includes functionality to format current date and time, prepare output file paths, and
       perform file operations using pickle serialization, tailored for Quantum Error Mitigation.

   math
       Encompasses all mathematical functions that are useful and utilized throughout the qrem package.
       This module aims to provide a comprehensive collection of mathematical tools specific to quantum
       research needs.

   povmtools
       This module contains functions operating on Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs),
       an essential aspect of quantum measurements. It provides tools for POVM analysis and manipulations.

   printer
       Contains helpful functions for logging and console printouts, facilitating better user
       interaction and debugging support within the QREM project.

   probability
       Dedicated to mathematical functions dealing with probability distributions, including
       the calculation of marginals, and other probability-related operations. This module
       supports probabilistic analyses within quantum computing contexts.

   registers
       #TODO

   utils
       A collection of general utility functions used throughout the QREM project. This module
       serves as a toolbox for common tasks and operations, enhancing code reuse and efficiency.

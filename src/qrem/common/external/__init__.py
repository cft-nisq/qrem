External Subpackages
====================

This subpackage contains external packages and modules adapted to be used in QREM package.
Ultimately, we would like to remove this subpackage and use external packages directly, 
but for now it is necessary to keep them modified internally.

All subpagases and modules are listed below:

Modules
-------
    ncpol2sdpa
        Ncpol2SDPA package by Peter Wittek, updated with minor bug fixes. Currently available version of PyPI requires some fixes.

        Adapted from https://github.com/Hannoskaj/Hyperplane_Intersection_Projection, with some minor modifications.

    CBB
        Adapted from Flavio Baccari's code, with some minor modifications.
